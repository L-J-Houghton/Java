Dear Examiner(s),

	I was unsure as to how question 1 of term 2 coursework would be assessed.
	I have decided to set the connection link as a local host link and
	have also provided an sql file containing the database 'students' 
	and table 'marks_table' with the correct fields that can be used
	if necessary.

	For the strategies research (question 2 , part 2) I have made two
	pdf files in this file directory, one for the naive strategy and 
	one for the advanced strategy.

	The programs can be found in the zip file and already have the 
	input/output txt files (for question 1) within them. 
	(Questions and corresponding programs):
	question 2 part 1 : Mastermind.java
	question 2 part 3 : Naive_strategy.java + input.java + output.java
	question 2 part 4 : Advanced_strategy.java + input.java + output.java

	(input.java and output.java are used to handle the input buttons and
	 output of buttons to simplify the Naive/Advanced strategy programs).
	 
	 I had also decided to expriment with swing and build my own basic GUI
	 for the program (I had checked with Dr Lahcen Ouarbya to confirm 
	 this was ok), there are minor positioning problems on GUI. On start 
	 you'll be asked by the dialog box if you'd like to play as a player 
	 or the machine to play.
	 
	 I had used the Oracle Java swing reference guide and the Java Language
	 reference guide online to refer to in order to develop/implement the 
	 strategies I had researched. Links to the online reference guides can 
	 be found in the code the programs.
 
	 Kind Regards,
		Luke Houghton
